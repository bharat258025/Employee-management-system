👨‍💼 Employee Management System

This project is a React-based Employee Management System with role-based login functionality, designed to manage and track tasks between managers and employees. It follows a clean component-based architecture and provides a smooth user experience without requiring a backend.

🚀 Overview

The system includes two main roles — Manager and Employee.
Managers can assign and monitor tasks, while employees can accept and track their task progress. A role-based login system ensures that each user accesses only their respective panel. All data is stored using localStorage, enabling persistence across sessions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

React.js – For building reusable UI components  
JavaScript (ES6+) – Core logic and interactivity  
HTML5 & CSS3 – Layout and styling
